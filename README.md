README.md made by TeemSucks on github
## Install & run

To download and install a bot run these following commands in command prompt:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/AllMesi/a-bot
cd a-bot
```

You also have to install the dependencies, to do so run this command:
```sh
npm i
```

After downloading the files make a new text file called __.env__. use this: 
```env
token="<YOUR BOT TOKEN>"
pastebin="[YOUR PASTEBIN KEY]"
```
(pastebin doesnt have a use for now, just have it there for future uses)

You can get your bots token from the discord developer portal. https://discord.com/developers/applications

You can now run the bot with this command:
```sh
npm start
```
